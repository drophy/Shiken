// TO DO
- Try to make it look ok on phone (the logo could be an image and maybe the credits be shorter). WAIT, use the transform scale property so the svg is the right size (I hope!)
- Try to style Google Sign in button (see guideliness in link in video at https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in#before_you_begin but I'd like to maybe make it longer and maybe remove the glow so it's uniform)
- Make a logo to use instead of 'Shiken'
- Change Play! button on hover
- Use @media to pick which background image to load
- Give it a little tab icon!
- New Logo
- Play around with adding a Zelda gif or something

// IDEAS
- In the "enter your username" page, have a random name creator
- Maybe even throw in a random fact while they wait!
- Add music!

// TO FIX / IMPROVE
- Maybe load the full res background image if the monitor has a resolution higher than 1080p

// FIXED
Issue: When making the window thiner, a white space appears under the background :/
Solution: Add html {height: 100%} to CSS (saw it in an old Colt project)

Issue: The logo animation would generate just like 99% of the outline
Solution: Made stroke-dasharray: 0 at the end with js using: logo[i].addEventListener("animationend", (event) => event.path[0].classList.add("full-path")); and adding that to the class
