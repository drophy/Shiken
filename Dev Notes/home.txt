// TO DO
- Try to make it look ok on phone (the logo could be an image and maybe the credits be shorter)
- Try to style Google Sign in button (see guideliness in link in video at https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in#before_you_begin but I'd like to maybe make it longer and maybe remove the glow so it's uniform)
- Make a logo to use instead of 'Shiken'
- Change Play! button on hover
- Use @media to pick which background image to load
- Play around with adding a Zelda gif or something
- Give it a little tab icon!

// IDEAS
- In the "enter your username" page, have a random name creator
- Maybe even throw in a random fact while they wait!
- Add music!

// TO FIX / IMPROVE
- Maybe load the full res background image if the monitor has a resolution higher than 1080p

// FIXED
Issue: When making the window thiner, a white space appears under the background :/
Solution: Add html {height: 100%} to CSS (saw it in an old Colt project)

Issue: The logo animation would generate just like 99% of the outline
Solution: Made stroke-dasharray: 0 at the end with js using: logo[i].addEventListener("animationend", (event) => event.path[0].classList.add("full-path")); and adding that to the class
