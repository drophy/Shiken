TODO
- Go to next page when host starts game (time out for now, I guess)
- We'll use the game's temporal code to get the game's ID and then we can get the game's data
- Right now there could definitely be concurrency issues that allow users to have repeated names
- Make sure someone added a players [] field in the game
- Replace image for actual Shiken mascot

IDEAS
- Generate random name
