// TO DO
- Figure out how to control the size/ratio; can it be 100% wide but not out-of-the-page high?
- Probably limit how many will show up in the graph to the first 5 or so; otherwise it would probably look like a mess (I mean, you could have an event with 50 or so players easily so... yeah; it would be cool-ish to see another graph with all of them to see how they did in general, using the same color and without labels, but we'll see)
