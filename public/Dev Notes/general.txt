TO DO
- Implement items
- Google sign in (at least comment it out >w<)

OPTIMIZE
- Sometimes initAnswers in voter.js doesn't run (Not sure if it's fixed yet, but it might be!)
    - Theory: TestInGame sends the message before voter.js can listen for it
    - Solution: either have TestInGame send it after a bit, a couple times...
    - when voter.js says it's ready (but, just the first one? all? what if someone disconnects?)
    - or have voter.js leave all 4 answers enabled if no message is received after a bit 
    - (if you go with the last option, validate in TestInGame that it's < correct.length or whatever)
    - Or, could we send the info to the server via a socket and have the others request it? And if they
    - request it before it's ready... maybe use a promise? 
- Block start quiz option till they edit it (send an alert and don't allow it to work? or start dummy quiz)
- Socket rooms or something. Having many games running at the same time would be a mess right now

IDEAS
- Integrate standings.html at the end (in standings2 there's a 'next' button instead of a 'finish one')
- I feel maybe the question and answers should be shown in answers.html too bc they might not remember

TO DO
- Make image have a max size or something so it never scrolls
- Define how items are going to work
- Edit items screen
- Have modal load the right quiz name instead of always 'My Game' or whatever it is
- Edit default quiz
- Consider moving save and exit button to somewhere more visible
- Add an "add image" option in editor. If no image is given, don't show it (instead of the toggle option)

Pedro
- Delete quiz from database
- Change 'user' on navbar to the user's email (or just the logout option)
- Remove image at quiz dashboard
- Change colors for new quiz button; it's hard to read on some screens
- Maybe remove description field
- Use bottons instead of a drop down to start/edit/delete
